/* Rules 

   Single cards: Any card from the deck, ordered by rank with suit being the tie-breaker. (For instance, A♠ beats A♥, which beats K♠.)

   Pairs: Any two cards of matching rank, ordered as with singular cards by the card of the higher suit. (A pair consisting of the K♠ and K♣ beats a pair consisting of K♥ and K♦.)

   Triples: Three equal ranked cards, three twos are highest, then aces, kings, etc. down to three threes, which is the lowest triple. In some variations, a triple can only be played as part of a 5-card hand.

   5-card hand: There are five (var. 2) different valid 5-card poker hands, ranking, from low to high, as follows (the same ranking as in poker):

   Straight (also known as a snake in Cantonese): Any 5 cards in a sequence (but not all of the same suit). Rank is determined by the value of the last card in the sequence, with the suit used only as a tie-breaker. Therefore 3-4-5-6-7 > 2-3-4-5-6, since 6 is considered the largest card in the 2-3-4-5-6 straight. The largest straight is 10-J-Q-K-A (J-Q-K-A-2 is invalid in some variations), while the smallest straight is A-2-3-4-5.

   Flush (also known as a flower): Any 5 cards of the same suit (but not in a sequence). Rank is determined by highest value card and then by highest suit. In some popular variations, flushes are not permitted as a playable hand, and thus it is the lowest possible combination.

   Full House: a composite of a three-of-a-kind combination and a pair. Rank is determined by the value of the triple, regardless of the value of the pair. Also known as a Fullen.

   Four of a kind + One card (nicknamed King Kong, tiki, or Bomb): Any set of 4 cards of the same rank, plus any 5th card. (A 4 of a kind cannot be played unless it is played as a 5-card hand) Rank is determined by the value of the 4 card set, regardless of the value of the 5th card. It is also known as a poker. (Some play the Four of a kind hand as the beat all, therefore nicknamed the bomb, King Kong, or also tiki.)

   Straight Flush: A composite of the straight and flush: five cards in sequence in the same suit. Ranked the same as straights, suit being a tie-breaker. (Sometimes also played as a bomb or tiki, larger than a Four of a Kind)
